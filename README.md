A demo to show a custom groovy class can call another custom groovy class in Katalon Studio.
=====

# What is this?

This is a simple Katalon Studio for demonstration purpose.
You can clone this out on you PC and execute it with your Katalon Stduio.

This project is developed to propose a solution for the following discussion:

- https://forum.katalon.com/discussion/6971/importing-custom-keywords-classes-recursively-within-a-custom-keyword#latest

Question raised there was:

>is there an officially supported way in Katalon Studio to call a Custom Keyword within a Custom Keyword that is defined in another class (and possibly also in another package)?

# Solution proposed

Yes. You can regard the "Keywords" directory is a directory where you can store any Groovy scripts.
I would rather like to rename the directory to "Custom scripts".

This demo shows how to do it.
